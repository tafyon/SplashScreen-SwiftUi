    An initial screen designed using Swift UI.
</p>
<br>


This project involves designing and creating an initial screen of an iOS application using Swift and Swift UI. The initial screen is the first screen displayed to the user when the application is opened. It typically includes the application's logo, name, and an interface that directs users to the main functionality. Swift UI is a framework provided by Apple for designing user interfaces (UI) and it adopts a declarative approach, meaning developers specify how the interface should look without having to deal with the details of how it is constructed.
